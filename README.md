This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

This application requires a `.env` file at the root of the project for you to be able to connect to our external api.

You can use this one:
`env.local`

```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api
```

Then you should be all set, run the following

```bash
npm run dev
```
